Today, rightfully, a lot of focus is put on the interactions between AI and humans (security, privacy, fairness...). However, another topic of crucial importance concerns the interactions between AI and AI as well as the potential problems that can arise from it. Any company having business to business (B2B) automated interactions faces the problem of learning from repeated interactions. A mechanism â€“ e.g. an auction (advertising), a contract, a market (electricity, goods, 5G...), the driving laws (self-driving cars) -- rules the interactions between the company and its partners / competitors. Very often, each player is using an AI to automate these interactions (decide a bid, a reserve price, a quantity of goods to sell/buy, driving a self-driving car...). Such system consists in a mechanism in which several AIs are going to interact. This raises numerous questions at the cross-road of numerous fields: Continuous / Discrete RL, Learning in Games, Stochastic Control, Game Theory, Mechanism Design...

* How to learn an AI playing in a repeated mechanism, when all AI agents are learning from one another?
* Does the whole system even stabilize? _Or do we risk to create the next high frequency trading crash?_ Under which conditions does it stabilize? Is this possible to ensure by mechanism design?
* How wealth / performance is shared between players? Are monopoly situations created?
* Are there players taking advantage of others at the cost of social welfare? _ex: Can the AI of a self-driving car learn that the AI from the other brand will always avoid in case of imminent frontal crash and thus learn to keep strait?_

The answers to these questions are crucial for numerous applications: the electricity market, the 5G network, the interactions between self-driving cars, the online auctions market, the financial market...
